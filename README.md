# $\pi$-StepNFT: Wider Space Needs Finer Steps in Online RL for Flow-based VLAs

**Main Results** (see paper for full protocol)
- **LIBERO (few-shot):** $\pi$-StepNFT improves performance by **32.9%** over SFT.
- **ManiSkill (OOD generalization):** $\pi$-StepNFT improves OOD success by **11.1%** over critic-based baselines by mitigating multimodal overfitting.

## Quick Start

For environment setup and simulator configuration details, please refer to the [RLinf](https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf) repository.

### Installation

Run experiments using the Docker image.

```bash
docker run -it --rm --gpus all \
   --shm-size 20g \
   --network host \
   --name rlinf \
   -v .:/workspace/RLinf \
   rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.1-maniskill_libero
   # For faster mirror downloads in mainland China, you can use:
   # docker.1ms.run/rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.1-maniskill_libero
```

Switch to the corresponding virtual environment using the built-in `switch_env` tool:

```bash
source switch_env openpi
```

For Maniskill,
```
cd <path_to_pi_StepNFT>/rlinf/envs/maniskill
# For faster downloads in mainland China, you can set:
# export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
hf download --repo-type dataset RLinf/maniskill_assets --local-dir ./assets
```

$\pi$-StepNFT (Step-wise Negative-aware Fine-Tuning) is a **critic-and-likelihood-free online RL framework** for flow-based vision-language-action (VLA) policies.
Flow-based VLAs rely on multi-step sampling, where action likelihoods are often intractable, hindering online RL.
Moreover, embodied control typically uses a **short denoising path** to meet interaction latency, and prior empirical evidence indicates diminishing returns from moderately longer paths.
To enable exploration, $\pi$-StepNFT adopts a reverse-time SDE formulation that injects stochasticity and yields a wider exploration space (**“Wider Space”**), and we identify that wider exploration spaces necessitate finer-grained, step-wise guidance for alignment (**“Finer Steps”**).
Instead of only supervising the terminal output, we motivate step-wise supervision that targets the **immediate next solver state**, using a **noise-aware regression** signal, and we introduce a logistic contrastive ranking loss with “push-pull dynamics” that maximizes the likelihood of successful trajectories while suppressing failed ones, which **eliminates auxiliary value networks**.
It requires only a single forward pass per optimization step, enabling scalable online adaptation for embodied VLAs.

**Highlights**
- **Critic- and likelihood-free** online RL for flow-based VLAs (no auxiliary value networks).
- **Wider Space:** SDE-based sampling expands the exploration manifold beyond deterministic ODE trajectories.
- **Finer Steps:** step-wise supervision targets the **immediate next denoising step** with a noise-aware regression signal.
- **Penalty-free preference learning:** a **logistic contrastive ranking loss** enforces push–pull dynamics (promote successes, suppress failures) to stabilize on-policy learning.
- **Efficient:** only **one forward pass per optimization step**, reducing training overhead and latency-critical complexity.



**Main Results** (see paper for full protocol)
- **LIBERO (few-shot):** $\pi$-StepNFT improves performance by **32.9%** over SFT.
- **ManiSkill (OOD generalization):** $\pi$-StepNFT improves OOD success by **11.1%** over critic-based baselines by mitigating multimodal overfitting.
